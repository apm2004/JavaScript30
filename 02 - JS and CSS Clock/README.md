# JS and CSS Clock

This project is a stylish analog clock built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) challenge by Wes Bos.

## Features
- Real-time analog clock with hour, minute, and second hands.
- Smooth hand transitions and a visually appealing design.
- Responsive and centered layout.

## How It Works
- The clock hands are rotated using JavaScript based on the current time.
- CSS handles the appearance, positioning, and transitions of the clock and its hands.
- When the second hand completes a full rotation, its transition is temporarily disabled to prevent a visual glitch.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Watch the clock update in real time!

## File Structure
- `index.html` â€“ Contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the clock.

## Credits
